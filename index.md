**Welcome!** Through this website, we will help each other stay up to date with new advances in our ever changing field. Our paper summaries will also help new members of VITALab to acquire essential knowledge about the state of the art. On this site, you'll find all the essential papers the VITALab members should be aware of.

## How to add a review

The process for adding reviews is _git-centric_. Basically, **you just need to add a file to the repo and make a pull request**. Let's go into the details :

1.  Clone [the `vitalab.github.io` repo](https://github.com/vitalab/vitalab.github.io) on your computer.
2.  Determine the category in which you will add your post. Categories are managed using folders :  
    
    ~~~
    _posts/           # A post added here will have no category
    course/
        _posts/       # A post added here will be in the "course" category
    machine-learning/
        _posts/       # Same thing for the "machine-learning" category
    ...               # There are other categories, you can add one too.
    ~~~
3.  Create the file `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-review.markdown` in right folder (see above).  
**You must use this format : date at the beginning and no spaces.** Else the page won't be built. A valid name would be : `2017-01-31-going-deeper-with-convolutions.markdown`.
4.  Copy this template in your new file :  
    
    ``` markdown

8.  When everybody is satisfied, **merge your branch and delete it**.

## Previewing your post locally

This site is built around [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll takes all the markdown files and generates a static html website.

1.  [Install Ruby using rbenv](/how-to-install-ruby). Don't use `apt-get` since its version of Ruby is too old.
2.  Install Jekyll by running : `gem install bundler jekyll`.
3.  Go where you cloned the repo and run : `bundle install`. This will install the dependencies for our Jekyll site.
4.  Run a local webserver using : `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
5.  Access the site locally at : <http://127.0.0.1:4000/>

Note that the site is automatically rebuilt when change a file.
