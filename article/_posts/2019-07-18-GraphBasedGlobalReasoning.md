# Highlights

The authors propose a so-called *Global Reasoning unit* (GloRe unit) that can be plugged in to existing
CNNs in order to help leveraging relationships between distant image regions.

Performance boost is shown in image classification (ImageNet), image segmentation (Cityscapes) and
video action recognition (Kinetics-400).

# Introduction

'*Relational reasoning between distant regions of arbitrary shape is crucial for many computer vision tasks* [...]'.

In CNN architectures this demands for a large number of layers in order to reach a sufficient receptive field
(e.g. full coverage of input data in ResNet-50 at 11th unit, '*near-end of Res4*').

*GloRe* enables interaction between distant parts of the input data '*in early stages of a CNN model*'.

# Methods

#### The GloRe unit

Given the input $$X \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times C}$$ the general strategy is as follows:
 - Project $$X$$ to interaction space $$\mathcal{H}$$ by $$V = f(X) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C}$$ with
 
   $$\mathbf{v}_i = \mathbf{b}_i X = \sum_{\forall j} b_{ij}\mathbf{x}_j$$
   
   and where $$B = [\mathbf{b}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_N] \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times L}, \mathbf{x}_j \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times C}, \mathbf{v}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times C}$$.
   Note that $$f(\phi(\mathbf{X}; W_\phi))$$, $$B = \theta(\mathbf{X}; W_\theta)$$
   and both $$\phi(\cdot)$$ and $$\theta(\cdot)$$ are implemented as convolution layers.
 - Perform '*reasoning with Graph Convolution*' by
 
   $$\mathbf{Z} = GVW_g = ((I - A_g)V)W_g$$
   
   where $$G$$ and $$A_g$$ are the '$$N \times N$$ *adjacency matrix for diffusing information across nodes,
   and $$W_g$$ the state update function*'.

 - Project back from interaction space to coordinate space by $$Y = g(Z)$$ where $$Z \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C}$$,
   $$Y \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times C}$$ and
   
   $$\mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{d}_i Z = \sum_{\forall j} d_{ij} \mathbf{z}_j.$$
   
   Note the choice of $$D = B^\mathsf{T}$$.


# Results

### Ablation study on ImageNet

**Notation**: 'R50+Our (n, m)' means inserting *n* GloRe units 'on Res3' and *m* GloRe units 'on Res4'.

**Findings**:
 - Adding one unit on Res3 is less effective than on Res4.
 - GloRe achieves better accuracy than Non-local Neural Nets (NL-NN).
 - Adding GloRe is more computationally efficient than increasing number of layers while maintaining performance.

### Image segmentation on Cityscapes

### Video action recognition on Kinetics-400

As opposed to the previous experiments in this one 3D CNNs are employed.

### Visualisation of GloRe weights

To increase resolution features to plot, a shallow ResNet-18 with one GloRe '*inserted in the middle of Res4*' is trained
on ImageNet with 512x512 input crops and $$N = 128$$ nodes in interaction space.
The figure below shows weights for four projection maps (i.e. $$\mathbf{b}_i$$).

# Conclusions

It seems that GloRe provides a computationally efficient way to boost performance of CNN approaches
in different kinds of tasks.

By single examples of visualised weight maps support the intuition that GloRe enables for a global interaction of
distant image features.

**Open Questions**:
 - What is the performance using this approach on earlier levels of the network? (A claim is that this is an efficient
   way 'early' interaction of features.)
 - Are the presented improvements significant?
