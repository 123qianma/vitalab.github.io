# Highlights
- Modality invariant transformer that provides a self-supervised signal and is used to predict future anatomical factors
from current ones
- State of the art performance compared to semi-supervised segmentation made by SDNet (from a previous paper by the same
group[^1])
- Preliminary results of cardiac temporal synthesis


# Introduction
The authors state that temporal correlations use in (cardiac) medical imaging has been limited to an additional
signal/supervision for segmentation tasks. They propose to use spatiotemporal dynamics to improve disentangled
representations.


# Methods

## Spatial Decomposition Network (SDNet)
> The SDNet framework is an attempt to decouple anatomical factors from their appearance towards more explainable
> representations.

The SDNet can be seen as an autoencoder that learns multiple subspaces, namely:
- $$s = f_A (x)$$: a multi-channel output of binary maps, representing the anatomical components
- $$z = f_M (x)$$: the $$Q(z \vert X)$$ multivariate Gaussian as in a standard VAE, representing the modality components

## Spatial Decomposition and Transformation Network (SDTNet)
The goal of this architecture is to learn anatomical factors that are both spatially and temporally consistent. To this
end, the authors add a UNet to act as a transformer and predict future anatomical components from current ones,
conditioned on temporal information. These deformed anatomical factors, together with the fixed modality factors $$z_t$$,
should be enough to reconstruct the input from a future time point.

Figure 1 illustrates the additions brought by SDTNet (in yellow) to the base SDNet framework.

The overall loss function is a weighted sum (determined empirically) of:

- $$L_S = L_{DICE}(y,\tilde{y}) + 0.1 \cdot L_{CE}(y,\tilde{y})$$, the supervised segmentation task cost;
- $$L_{US} = |\tilde{x} - x| + \lambda_{KL} \cdot D_{KL}[Q(z|X) \| N(0,I)] - MI(\tilde{x},z)$$, the cost of the 
unsupervised encoding task;
- $$L_{ADV}$$ is the adversarial loss of a Least-Squares GAN to discriminate ground truth from predicted segmentations;
- $$L_{TR}$$ is the self-supervised signal, represented as the Dice loss between $$\tilde{s}_{t+dt}$$ and $$s_{t+dt}$$.

The authors optimized the model using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), claiming that it detects wider and more
generalizable minima.


# Data
The experiments were performed on a 3-fold cross-validation split of ACDC's training set. To obtain consistent temporal
transformations, the authors split the sequences in two halves:
- The ED-ES interval were left as is;
- The frames from ES to the end of the cardiac cycle were reversed in temporal order to mimic the cardiac contraction.

# Remarks
- Although the authors mention temporal consistency often in relation to their transformer, no evaluation of the
temporal coherence, either quantitative or simply qualitative, is provided.
