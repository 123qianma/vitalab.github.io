# Highlights

Using GANs to segment tumors from whole body MRI.

# Introduction

This is a very simple paper with a cute idea.  Not clear however how well it works in reality but at least it is worth mentioning.  Segmentation is done as follows:

* First a GAN is trained on a wbMRI of *healthy subjects* (c.f. fig 1 for results of 4 different GANs)
* Second a real wbMRI with a tumor is considered.  With it, they recover the latent vector which produces the synthetic image which is the most similar to that of the real image
* They subtract the synthetic from the real image.  This results into a black image everywhere except where the tumor is.

# Results

Results are illustrated in fig.2.  They get better results than an [old] watershed method.

Also, StyleGAN2 gets very nice results as reported by the expert score in Table 1.
