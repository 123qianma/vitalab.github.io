## Summary
In this paper, they propose a deep semantic segmentation-based layered image compression (DSSLIC) framework in which the semantic segmentation map of the input image is obtained and encoded as the base layer of the bit-stream.
A compact representation of the input image is also generated and encoded as the first enhancement layer.
The segmentation map and the compact version of the image are then employed to obtain a coarse reconstruction of the image.
The residual between the input and the coarse reconstruction is additionally encoding as another enhancement layer.

## Network Details

* FLIF enc/dec: state-of-the-art lossless image codec.
* BPG enc/dec: state-of-the-art lossy coding.
* CompNet for generating a low-dimensional version $$c$$ of the original image.
* SegNet for generating the semantic segmentation map $$s$$ of the input image $$x$$.
* FineNet is trained to learn the missing fine information of the up-sampled version of $$c$$ concerning the input image.


# Use of the GAN

This model is composed of two networks: discriminator($$D(x)$$) and generator($$G(z)$$), they are trained at the same time.
The generator model $$G(z)$$ captures the data distribution by mapping the latent z to data space.
The discriminator model $$D(x) \epcillon [0, 1]$$ estimates the probability that x is a real training sample or a fake sample synthesized by $$G$$.
These two models compete in a two-player minimax game in which the objective function is to find a binary classifier $$D$$ that discriminates the real data from the fake (generated) ones and simultaneously encourages $$G$$ to fit the true data distribution.

## Other application
Since semantic segmentation map includes in the bit-stream, the proposed scheme can facilitate many other tasks such as image search and object-based adaptive image compression.
