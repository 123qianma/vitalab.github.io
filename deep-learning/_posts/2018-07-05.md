This paper developed a method to reduce large two-dimensional images to significantly smaller “feature lists.” These feature lists overcome the problem of storing and manipulating large amounts of data. A new artificial neural network using conjugate gradient training methods, operating on sets of feature lists, was successfully trained to determine the presence or absence of wakes in synthetic aperture radar images.

**Images: radar, 4000 x 4000 pixels for a 25m of resolution by pixel**

Because radar satellites refresh only few seconds, the ocean-surface features such as internal wave signatures due to tidal flows over the continental shelf and ship wakes were observed in Seasat data to have long duration and allow ship detection.

In order to ensure that the entire wake appears in the digital representation, radar images would require between 10^6 and 10^8 pixels.

## Main Idea

A wake-detection system based on techniques for mapping input radar images into sets of one-dimensional feature lists, which can then be input to an artificial neural network. The mapping significantly reduces the quantity of data, which reduces the memory and training requirements so that an artificial neural network can be used.

Results are presented for a wake-processing system operating on radar imagery produced by numerical simulation and by data collected with the NASA-JPL AirSAR. We show that a new conjugate gradient training.

A new conjugate gradient training method as applied to back-propagation learning is superior to the conventional steepest-descent method.

## Preprocessing

They use concepts of planewave detection in the Fourier space to develop the algorithm.

"Line detection" is the Fourier transform of a function f(x,y) with the Fourier power spectrum by |F|^2=FF*.

"feature vector" is the normalization of the signal to it's sum.

"Feature list" is a pair of numbers, one for each tile, consisting of the maximum probability and its angle.

Summary:
1. A starting $$\vec{o}^{\,t}$$ point is selected by initializing the weights randomly, uniformly distributed between -0.5 and +0.5. The gradient go is cornputed at this point and an initial search direction vector do = -go is selecied.
2) The constant ak which minimizes f ( i ? k
q d k ) is
computed by line search. The weight vector is updated to
the new point: Zk + = Zk akdk.
3) The termination criteria are evaluated at the new
point. If the error at this point is acceptable or if the max-
imum number of function and gradient calculations has
been reached, the algorithm t5rminates.
4) A new direction vector d k + I is computed. If k
1
i_s an integral multiple of N (t$e dimension of Z), thzn
d k + l =
Otherwise, d k + l = -g’k+I + &dk,
where O k is computed according to the method selected by
the user: Fletcher-Reeves [lo], Polak-Ribikre [ 1 1 1 , or
Hestenes-Stiefel [ 121.
5 ) k is replaced by k + 1 , and the algorithm continues
as before in Step 2.





## Annotation

The annotated images by a quadrilateral bounding boxes, which can be denoted as "x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4" where (xi, yi) denotes the positions of the oriented bounding boxes' vertices in the image.

```bash
'imagesource':imagesource
'gsd':gsd
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, category, difficult
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, category, difficult
...						
```
note: 'gsd' is the ground sample distance, the physical size of one image pixel, in meters.
