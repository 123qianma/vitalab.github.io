### Description
This paper open the door to the use of GANs for hyperspectral Images classification.
They show the efficacity of different GANs combined with conditional random fields. The reason of that, is to use in full potentiel the large amount of unlabled data.

#### Datasets
- Indian Pines (IN)
- University of Pavia (UP)

### Methodology
Inspired by semi-supervised GAN, they proposed a spectral-spacial convolutional layer to construct both discriminators and generators. Adding to that, a CRF to refines the posterior probability. The loss optimization is not suitable for GANs so they they include labeling information to generalize the GANs for semi-supervised task.

- L1: supervised loss
- L2: unsupervised loss for cheating discriminator
- l3: unsupervised loss for generator

They applied a fully -connected CRF that takes all pixels in a HSI and its corresponding predicted labels in classification map as and links them together to build a graph.

### Experiments Results
- Spectral-Spatial GAN (SS)
- Autoencoder (AE)
- CNN + PCA (CNN-PCA)
- traditional CNN, spatial only network (SPA)
- Spectral only network (SPC)

### Conclusions
Promising results and open the window for semisupervisedlearning of hysperspectral image classification.
* That article can be join to another article "Non-local tensor completion for multitemporal remotely sensed images inpainting"[^fn] (non deep-learning article) then implement a new method to reshaping multitemporal spectral images with better results.
