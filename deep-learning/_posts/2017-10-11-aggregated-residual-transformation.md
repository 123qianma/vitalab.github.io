This parper main contribution is a new "cardinality" for the resnet block.

## Model

The difference from the resnet block and resnext block is really simple and well resumed in Figure 1.

They split the convolution in multiple parts (Figure 1 in 32 part). They argue that the cardinality dimension control the number of complex transformations and is more effective than width or depth dimension. Table 1 show side by side a resnet with a resnext with the same number of parameters and the same FLOPS.

where $$C$$ is the cardinality discussed before and it produce groups of convolution as in Figure 1.

## Results

They report result on three and half dataset Imagenet 1k, Cifar10, MSCOCO, and Imagenet 1k trained on Imagenet 5k
