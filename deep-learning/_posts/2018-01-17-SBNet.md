### Description
The authors proposed a novel non-sparse convolution algorithm. They use a mask that is known and can apply to input images.for example, in a autonomous driving, only the areas on the roads are interested and be accessible from the off-line mode. This mask is a binary(active/inactive) to represent the available regions for CNN, and all operation will be placed on the active part of images.The binary mask has been converted to a list of indices, where each index belong to the location of the corresponding pixel (Fig:1 ).
  


The authors used two operations before and after a convolution in each layer to be transferred between dense and sparse modes called gather and scatter. 

In gather mode, given a list \[B,3\] where B is number of index in list, and "3" is ( chanel number, x-position,y-position), the input size $ N * H * W * C$ is changed to $B * H* w * C$, and this operation get inverse in scatter kernel.
