Xception is a model which improves upon the Inception V3 model[^1]. Its author makes the following proposition : the Inception module lies in a discrete spectrum of formulations that range from a regular convolution[^2] at one end, to a depthwise separable convolution at the other extreme. Thus the name "Xception", which means "Extreme Inception", as this new model uses depthwise separable convolutions in a model that is inspired by Inception V3.
