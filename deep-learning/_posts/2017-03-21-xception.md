Xception is a model which improves upon the Inception V3 model[^1]. 

Its author postulates that "the fundamental hypothesis behind Inception is that **cross-channel correlations and spatial correlations are sufficiently decoupled that it is preferable not to map them jointly**". This decoupling is implemented in the Inception module by a 1x1 convolution followed by a 3x3 convolution (see fig. 1 and 2).

Furthermore, the author makes the following proposition : the Inception module lies in a **discrete spectrum of formulations** that range from a regular convolution (preceded by a 1x1 conv) at one extreme, to a depthwise separable convolution at the other extreme. Thus the name "Xception", which means "Extreme Inception", as this new model uses depthwise separable convolutions.

To convince ourselves that the Inception module is an intermediate formulation of the said spectrum, let us compare figure 3 and 4. A regular convolution (not shown) would span the entire channel space (there would be a **single segment**). The reformulation of the simplified Inception module uses **three segments**. Figure 4 shows a module that uses a **separate convolution for each channel**.

A depthwise separable convolution, commonly called “separable convolution” in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, consists in a _depthwise convolution_, i.e. a spatial convolution performed independently over each channel of an input, followed by a _pointwise convolution_, i.e. a 1x1 convolution, projecting the channels output by the depthwise convolution onto a new channel space. This is not to be confused with a **spatially separable convolution**, which is also commonly called “separable convolution” in the image processing community.

There is two minor differences between a depthwise separable convolution and the module shown in figure 4 : the order of the two operations, and the presence or absence of a non-linearity between those operations. The author argues that the first does not matter. The second difference is important, and **the absence of non-linearity improves accuracy** (see figure 10).
