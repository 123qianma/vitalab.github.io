### Description
In this paper, they want to incrase the spacial resolution for hyperspectral images to match with deferent spacial resolution of the differents captors. For that they created a three-dimensional full CNN (3D-FCNN) is constructed for spatial Super Resolution of hyperspectral images.

To do that they exploit both the spatial context of neighboring pixels and spectral correlation of neighboring bands. Changing the 2D covultion to a 3D convolution.

The architecture of the proposed 3D-FCNN fully explore spatial-spectrl features in the data cube. First, because of the low resolution of the inpout, they up-scaled the input of the desired output size using a bicubic interpolation. In the same time the up-scaling alleviating the spectraldistortion during the convolution. In the structure, we find four convolutional layers and the input image will be $$ 33 \times 33 \times c \times 1$$, where $$33 \times 33$$ is the spatial dimension, $$c$$ the number of spectral layers and the $$ 1$$ is the color channel for the HSI (Hyperspectral imaging). Between those four, the 'ReLU' fontion is used as activation function for nonlinear mapping.

In the table below, we have the different kernels size associated with layers.

To provid border effects they does'nt add any padding in any convolutions. At the end, is the MSE (mean squared error) between outputs and ground-truth  who is use as a cost function.

Well train with good parameters they want to use this trained network on differents datasets obtained from the same sensor.

### Results
In this paper they use the mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (MPSNR) and the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) to evaluate the spatial performance of the system. To provide a score on the spectral performance, is the spectral angle mapper (SAM) between the reconstructed spectra and their corresponding ground-truth spectra who is used.
