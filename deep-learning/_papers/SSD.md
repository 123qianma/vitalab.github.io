Single shot MultiBox Detector

## Summary

**SSD** is an adaptation of **YOLO** to support prior shapes. Using prior shapes, **SSD** doesn't need to learn the aspect ratio, it predicts the correct prior box and the class. Also, SSD is using multiples features map to achieve a better performance.

## Model

The model is using the **VGG-16** model for its base. It then uses severals features maps to produce its output.

It's a more complex model than **YOLO** but it's faster because the input size is smaller.

Using Atrous Convolution speed up the model by 20%

### Default boxes

Default boxes are computed from the training sets, they are similar to the anchor boxes from R-CNN. They help the network getting the right aspect-ratio.



## Loss

The loss function is similar to **YOLO**'s loss function. Instead of multiples detection per cell, it predict a box per default box. The loss is computed on the default boxes with a Jaccard overlap bigger than 0.5. This allows multiples prediction per cell.
