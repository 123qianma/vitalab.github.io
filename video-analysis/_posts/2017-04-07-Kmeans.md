K-means is a typical clustering method, which can also be used for motion detection. 

###Steps
1. For each pixel in the video, based on its prevrous values, a group of K (usually K = 3~5) clusters are clustered by using K-means. For each cluster, a weight w_k (the more samples it contains, the higher the weight is) and a center c_k (mean) are stored.

2. For each new frame, the new pixel value is compared with each culster of the pixel ( the Manhattan distance between the new pixel value and the center of each cluster is calculated). 
	a. If no cluster matched, (i.e. all distances are bigger than a threshold), the cluster with the lowest weithgt will be replaced by a new cluster with its mean equal to the new pixel value (similar to GMM). 
	b. Else if a cluster matched, (i.e. A: the distance between its center and the new pixel value is smaller than a threshold, and at the same time B: cluster has the hignest weight among the clusters that satisfy condition A), the weight and the center of that cluster will be updated.

3. Normalize the weights for all the clusters.

4. Sort all the clusters from high to low according to their weights.

5. Sum all the weights of the cluters which are before the cluster that the new pixel belongs to. The higher the sum is, the higher probability the new pixel belongs to a foreground, vise versa.
$$P = \sum^{K-1}_{k>M_k}w_k$$,

where $$M_k$$ is the cluster index of the matching cluster.

The pipeline of the K-means for motion detection is shown in Fig. 1.

The authors also used a connected components algorithm for the post-processing. Example results are shown in Fig. 2.
