## Intro
They proposed three algorithms and validate their effectiveness and properties for solving cost-sensitive online classification problems.
They approximate the second covariance matrix Î£ by a small number of carefully selective directions.
That technique is called *sketch*, which significantly accelerates the computational speed with little performance losses.
